Programming Language Design Outline
TOOTH
1. Introduction
•	Purpose of the language
To get a better understanding of programming when creating this language.
•	Target audience and use cases
Myself 
2. Syntax
•	Lexical elements (tokens, keywords, operators)
See C:\Projects\tooth_language
•	Expression and statement syntax
•	Control structures (loops, conditionals)
•	Function and procedure syntax
•	Class/Module/Package structures (if applicable)
3. Semantics
•	Variable types and declarations
•	Scope rules
•	Function and procedure semantics
•	Class/Object semantics (if object-oriented)
•	Error handling and exceptions
4. Paradigm
•	Programming paradigm (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)
•	Rationale for chosen paradigm
•	Examples of paradigm-specific features
5. Conclusion
•	Summary of the language's key features
•	Comparison with existing languages
•	Future development and enhancements

# Tooth Programming Language

## Overview

Tooth is a high-performance, safe, and versatile programming language, merging the best of Rust and C#, and built using C++ and LLVM. It's designed for complex, computationally intensive tasks across various domains.

## Features

- **Purpose and Domain:** Tailored for efficiency and accuracy in a broad range of computational challenges.
- **Syntax and Readability:** A mix of Python's simplicity with C#'s structured, type-safe approach.
- **Type System:** Statically typed, integrating strong typing with type inference for enhanced performance.
- **Memory Management:** A hybrid system, combining automatic garbage collection with manual control akin to Rust.
- **Runtime Environment:** Utilizes the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR), ensuring broad cross-platform support and interoperability within the .NET ecosystem.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism:** Features a hybrid model, blending traditional threading with async/await patterns for optimal performance.
- **Standard Library and Ecosystem:** A comprehensive suite including data structures, networking, mathematical utilities, and essential debugging tools. Encourages open-source community contributions.
- **Error Handling:** Employs a hybrid approach, combining Option Types for safe and explicit error management with selective use of exceptions.
- **Interoperability:** Designed for seamless integration with .NET libraries and frameworks, leveraging its CLR-based architecture.
- **Tooling and Development Environment:** Robust toolset including a CLR bytecode compiler, integrated debugging tools, strong IDE support, and a package manager.
- **Platform Support:** Ensures broad compatibility with major operating systems, leveraging its flexible runtime environment.
- **Community and Collaboration:** A community-driven open-source project, prioritizing collaboration, documentation, and developer engagement.
- **Extensibility:** Supports extensive customization through plugins and embedded DSLs, adaptable to evolving user needs.

Built with C++ and LLVM, Tooth is positioned to be a powerful tool in the arsenal of modern developers, combining performance, safety, and versatility in a unique and user-friendly package.
